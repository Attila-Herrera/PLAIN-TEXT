  Ravenloft is a famous module; It numerous adaptations and reboots. My research on Ravenloft revealed its importance, not just as an inspiration for books but as an innovation for D&D modules. If you are new to D&D understanding a module is very simple. If you imagine the D&D game as a television then imagine the module as the show you would watch. A module can be anything from the adventures on the high seas or a romp through a dungeon. The importance of Ravenloft, is how it changes the established formula in ways that benefeit the medium as a whole.

  Ravenloft was written in 1983 as a stand alone advnture, but was so popular it was written as a campaign guide in 1990. Its authors ,Tracy and Laura Hickman, originally wrote Ravenloft after an experience they had in another D&D module. They were just slaying monsters when they came across a vampire. Its purpose  was to be killed by the players, but it got Tracey thinking about how cool of an enemy a vampire was; it deserved more than to die as a nameless mook in some random dungeon. Brainstorming ideas, Tracey and his wife created the Ravenloft module. This module planned to tell a great and tragic tale. The main antagonist ,Vampire Count Strahd, was not the big bad because of the rules within the game but because he was a despot. He was a monster who stole peoples' comforts and terroized citizens. Though he was once a man, he was cursed with guilt. Through his actions, he became a monster. Not just literally, but figuratively as well. The Ravenloft module inspires the players to fight this villian through its story.

  The Ravenloft module was also mechanically innovative, having vertical maps that were uncommon at the time. Since D&D is a table top board game, the world around the players is often represented by a flat grid. These grids are usually the only representation players will get of their surroundings, and any monsters or enviroment details can be found represented within these flat grids. Ravenloft changed this by adding more verticallity to dungeons and encounters. Most D&D grids assumed that the entire dungeon fit on the same level. However Castle Ravenloft is a vertical dungeon. It stands above a large canyon, and the castle itself spans more than 5 floors, plus basements and secret rooms. Because of this the dungeon can take on numerous new paths. In addition encounters can be more exciting because battles can include 3 dimensions.
  
  Castle Ravenloft also uses random probability in unique ways, though random chance is not new in D&D.  Many modules include monster encounter tables in D&D exist, which will randomnly generate monsters for the players to fight. Castle Ravenloft tables are broader and affect more. The location of specific items is randomized, and the overall plot points can change depending on the certain dice rolls.  The magic macguffin to defeat the antagonist was placed in a different location each time the module was played. It could be placed in tombs, or in throne rooms. Even antagonist himself can appear in a vareity of locations. The motives for the big bad Strahd also could change. He could be looking to turn on of the players into a vampire, or he might be looking for the soul of his lost love. These random elements made the module more replayable while also creating stories unique to each group of plaers.
  
The Ravenloft module is a part of the history of Dungeons and Dragons. It has directied the course of the game in the ensuing years. Even modules that did not focus on story still lifted aspects of Ravenloft, such as vertical maps and modular design. To this day Ravenloft has a venerable position as a cornerstone of Dungeon and Dragon design. There have been numerous adaptations of Ravenloft for every edition of D&D since its inception in 1983. Entire campaign settings have been made to answer questions of the numerous fans, books have been written and new modules have been made.  Ravenloft remains a successful module to the Dungeons and Dragons vault, with many more story based modules owing their existence to the precedent that Ravenloft had established.
