The Curse of Strahd campaign guide, which is the 2016 adaptation of the more famous Ravenloft module.

  The Ravenloft module did many things that are unique for a D&D module. The Ravenloft module had vertical maps that were uncommon at the time. Since D&D is a table top board game, the world around the players is often represented by a flat grid. These grids are usually the only representation players will get of their surroundings, and any monsters or enviroment details can be found represented within these grids. Ravenloft changed this by adding more verticallity to dungeons and encounters. Most D&D grids are assumed  to be on a flat surface, where all the rooms and floors are on the same level. However Castle Ravenloft is a vertical dungeon. It is standing above a large canyon, and the castle itself spans more than 5 floors, plus basements, and secret rooms. Because of this the dungeon can take on numerous new paths. In addition encounters can be more exciting because battles can include 3 dimensions.
